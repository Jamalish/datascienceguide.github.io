[SQL on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/sql/) is a great resource for learning (and practicing SQL)

[Hands on SQL Tutorial with SQLite](sql-introudction) is guide created by us, in conjuction with Darell Aucoin and uWaterloo's stats club.


Once you think you understand databases and SQL well enough, you go can go back to the [required background](required-background) and complete the rest of the modules.
