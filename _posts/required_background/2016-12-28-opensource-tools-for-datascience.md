title:  "Open Source Tools for Data Science"
categories: introduction 
---

Many tools exist!  One can start with excel since it is the most basic for dealing with tabular data, later we focus on open source tools: first with workbenches/ interfaces and then programming frameworks.

I personally recommend python if you are interesting in doing analysis and build production systems.  Python is easy to learn and in high demand in industry.  If you want to focus on analysis and want access to more statistical packages (instead of a general programming language) I recommend R.  If you do not want to code, WEKA might have the functionality you are looking for.

# Why open source?

TODO: ellaborate
-  view source code, contribute, free innovation, cross platform, not tied down, no expensive licenses (or license issues)

# Running servers

TODO: talk about why running servers is better and create a guide

## Excel/ Open Office

## Java Work Benches

Java-based environments, workbenches and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that can be used for data science.  From the [original article](http://machinelearningmastery.com/java-machine-learning/) outlining more details.

## [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)

Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (Weka) is a data mining platform created by the University of Waikato, New Zealand. It  provides a graphical user interface, command line interface and Java API. It is perhaps the most popular Java machine learning library and a great place to start or practice machine learning.

**Recommended for beginners**, great out of the box visualizations

## Other Jave tools (I have not used)

### KIME

Konstanz Information Miner

### RapidMiner 


### ELKI 

Environment for DeveLoping KDD-Applications Supported by Index-Structures (ELKI)

# Programming Frameworks

Why write code?
- reproducable
- scales better
- easily distributed (run on servers)

## Java Libraries

### Java-ML

### JSAT

# Python Libraries

## ScitKit learn

## Xgboost

## Orange
Has both a GUI and an interface for data mining

## R

R Studio

Rattle (http://rattle.togaware.com/)

(that other R IDE)

# Database tools

## SQL

### SQLlite

### MySQL

### PosgreSQL

## NoSQL

# Big data tools and Next Steps

We created a section for [big data tools](/opensource-bigdata-tools/) which outline popular opensource tools for big data.  This section is optional for now (until you get to big data).  If you want to move on, you can go to the [DataScience Framework](/data-science-framework/).
