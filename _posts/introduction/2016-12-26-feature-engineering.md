## Extract/Transform/Load

Extract: data is usually stored in a form of a warehouse.  It needs to be extracted (for example using SQL)
Transform: Data is rarely in the necessary form for analysis
Load: Once transformed, it can be loaded into another database or warehouse

# Transforming Data


## Binning Numerical Data

If numerical data needs to transformed into categorical data, it can be binned into groups

## Encoding Categorical Data


## Data Cleaning

### Outlier Detection

As part of the data cleaning stage, outliers can be detected through [outlier detection](outlier-detection).  Once outliers are determined, they can be removed and then ignored or imputed.  Alternatively there are algorithms which robustly ignore (or deal with) outliers.

### Imputing

### Filtering
