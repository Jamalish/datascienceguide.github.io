## What is deep learning?

In short, most machine learning deals with manually determining features (see [featuring engineering](datascienceguide.github.io/feature-engineering))based on the datascientists understanding of the dataset.  For better generalized artifical intelligence, the algorithms need to be less dependant on manual feature engienering, rather be able to determine features on their own explanatory factors.

Before diving deeply onto the topics of deep learning, it is recommended to understand how the general alogorithms work first which will give you a stronger understanding once you are dealing with unstructured data (which deep learning works best on).

Since many of the deep learning topics are subjects on their own, we will outline the common applications here, and thoughout the guide have special sections for each topic.
