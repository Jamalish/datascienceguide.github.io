# What questions to Ask?

## What is Machine learning?

Talk about what is machine learning, pattern recognition, artificial intelligence and data mining

## Correlation does not imply causation

## Garbage in, Garbage out

# Issues with Data Science

1. Computational complexity
- Can not evaluate all models and parameters
2. Validation or evaluation
- How to pick the best algorithm?   
- Test with smaller set of data
3. Data skew.
- Data can be misleading or incorrect
- See data aggrigation
4. Interpretation
- Human in the loop (domain expertise) is necessary to understand
- Made from subset of population
- Data Mining does stereotyping by default
5. Ethics/Data Privacy
