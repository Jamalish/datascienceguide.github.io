## About this guide

This originally was written by [Andrew Andrade](http://mrandrewandrade.com) and [Professor Lukasz Golab](http://www.engineering.uwaterloo.ca/~lgolab/) as suplimental notes for [MSCI 723](http://www.ucalendar.uwaterloo.ca/SA/GRAD/1516/GRDcourse-MSCI.html#MSCI723) a graduate course about [data science, data mining and big data](https://uwaterloo.ca/management-sciences/news/data-analytics-courses-available)  (and MSCI 446 - Data Warehousing and Mining).  Since the students come from many different backgrounds (some non-technical) we strived to provide many optional background readings (both for beginners and advanced practitioners) which we think will be useful to becoming a better data scientist.

The goal is now to provide a comprehensive guide to data science starting with an approach for small to [medium data](http://svdictionary.com/words/medium-data), and later outline big data analysis. It is more managable to learn the techniques with smaller data sets which fit in memory first, and then move onto analysis of very large datasets which might require multiple computers.

The notes provide a high level overview of topics and the tutorials provide hands on examples (and code)

While we attempt to be comprehensive, this guide is still a work in progress and we look foward to edits, improvements and suggetions. Please feel free to send us a [pull request](https://github.com/datascienceguide/datascienceguide.github.io) or send edits or suggestions to [Andrew](mailto:andrew@andrewandrade.ca)
